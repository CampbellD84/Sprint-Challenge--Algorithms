#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) increases n times while the condition is met

b) O(n log n) => sum increases by 1 but j is squared

c) O(n) => bunnies changes by 1

## Exercise II

Take the building's n-story and divide by 2. If drop egg and it breaks at that floor f, divide the floors below in half and keep going until answer is found. If drop egg and does NOT break, divide the floors above in half and keep going until answer is found.

This would be a Binary Search with a runtime of O(log n).
